// Slice is a collection of types of data, just like arrays.
// However, unlike arrays, slice doesn't hava a fixed size. 

// A slice in Golang
numbers := []int{2, 4, 6, 8, 15}

// The bracket [] notation was left empty. 
// This is because we can add elements to a slice and change its size.

// this is an array
num := [5]int{2, 4, 6, 8, 15}

// this is a slice
numb := []int{2, 4, 6, 8, 15}
